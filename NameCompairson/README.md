This code was compiled in eclipse and is meant for the
latest JRE. 

To use simply open a command line to this folder and type
java -jar NameLinkingAlgorithem.jar.

If you want to modify the search parameter or any of the names 
that are being searched for, simply edit the res/testSet.txt
It is important not to change the names, location, or formatting of
any of these testing files.

The program currently will assign a value to every name that is in
the test set. That value corresponds to the confidence the program has
that the name in question matches the current name, one being 100% confident.
