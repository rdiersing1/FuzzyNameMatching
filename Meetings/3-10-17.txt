I have transferred the name normalizer to java code so that I could use the 
NLP API for java on java name objects. I then proceded to make a collection of 
string comparison algorithms using the Stanford NLP API. I then made a overarching
comparison method which sums all of the smaller comparison algorithms together. It 
is not yet properly weighted which I hope to fix soon, but with the small test set
I created all of the instances of the name being searched for had a higher value
than the other names in the set. I will fix the weighting system on my overall
comparison algorithm to achieve more contrast between these values.
