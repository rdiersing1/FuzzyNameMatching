I have a busy week coming up so I decided to start working on the project early, here is what I 
have so far:

Names Testing Set:
All names in the test set were taken from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_writers
I copied these lists into a file named NameSet and used the NameSetBuilder that I created to 
format it so I just had the full names (Plus a few minor adjustments by hand).

Time finding set of names: 30 min
Time building NameCleaner program: 90 min

Name Disambiguation:
All names are given to the algorithm in an input file, and the normalized names are output in
another file along with any information the algorithm gathered. All of the names are ordered 
with the title first if they have one, then the name components in alphabetical order.

The set of all titles the algorithm will recognize are passed in to the algorithm in a text file
All text files passed into the algorithm are specified in the config.txt file, which MUST REMAIN
config.txt (or else the algorithm will not find it).

Time spent on Name Disambiguation(normalization) algorithm so far: 4.5 hours
Time spent on this document: 30 min

I have now imported a set of all nick names and for every nickname in the set of names, the algorithm
will recognize that the name block is a nick name and will recommend possible names. (Note may also
want to include the likeness of substitution). 

Time spent working on this part of the algorithm 2 hours
